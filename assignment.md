# Assignment

## Brief

Write the SQL statements for the following questions.

## Instructions

Paste the answer as SQL in the answer code section below each question.

### Question 1

Using the `claim` and `car` tables, write a SQL query to return a table containing `id, claim_date, travel_time, claim_amt` from `claim`, and `car_type, car_use` from `car`. Use an appropriate join based on the `car_id`.

Answer:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    claim_date,
    travel_time,
    claim_amt,
    car_type,
    car_use
FROM
    claim
    LEFT JOIN car on claim.car_id = car.id;
```

### Question 2

Write a SQL query to compute the running total of the `travel_time` column for each `car_id` in the `claim` table. The resulting table should contain `id, car_id, travel_time, running_total`.

Answer:

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    car_id,
    travel_time,
    SUM(travel_time) OVER (
        PARTITION BY
            car_id
        ORDER BY
            id
    ) AS running_total
FROM
    claim;
```

I left out the partition initially. Then I used car_id for both partition and order by. This is not ideal.

### Question 3

Using a Common Table Expression (CTE), write a SQL query to return a table containing `id, resale_value, car_use` from `car`, where the car resale value is less than the average resale value for the car use.

Answer:

```sql
WITH
    avg_resale_value_by_car_use AS (
        SELECT
            car_use,
            AVG(resale_value) AS average_resale_value
        FROM
            car
        GROUP BY
            car_use
    )
SELECT
    id,
    resale_value,
    c1.car_use
FROM
    car c1
    INNER JOIN avg_resale_value_by_car_use c2 ON c1.car_use = c2.car_use
WHERE
    resale_value < average_resale_value;
```
